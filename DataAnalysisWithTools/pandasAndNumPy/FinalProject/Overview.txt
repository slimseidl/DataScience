The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives.
Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase.
The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov(opens in a new tab).
The **NICS data** contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type.
The **U.S. census data** contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have one data point per state (2016), but a few have data for more than one year.


Example questions 


What census data is most associated with high gun per capita?
Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations? 
What is the overall trend of gun purchases?



Rubric 

Criteria	Submission Requirements
Does the code work?

All code is functional and produces no errors when run.
The code given is sufficient to reproduce the results described.
Does the project use NumPy and Pandas appropriately?

The project uses NumPy arrays and Pandas Series and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries.
Where possible, vectorized operations and built-in functions are used instead of loops.
Does the project use good coding practices?

The code makes use of at least 1 function to avoid repetitive code.
The code contains good comments and meaningful variable names, making it easy to read.
Tip At least one (1) function is required and it has to be used more than once. For example:

Every plot has to have a title and axis labels (to meet a later requirement), you can create a function to add those to each visualization.
When a cleanup requires multiple steps and applies to several columns, you may write a function that accepts a DataFrame and a column name, and reuse it for each column.
Quality of Analysis
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Is a question clearly posed?

The project clearly states one or more questions, then addresses those questions in the rest of the analysis.

Data Wrangling Phase
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Is the data cleaning well documented?

The project documents any changes that were made to clean the data, such as merging multiple files, handling missing values, etc.

Exploration Phase
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Is the data explored in many ways?

The project investigates the stated question(s) from multiple angles. That is:

The project explores at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest.
The project performs both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.
Tip For all questions, include both 1d and 2d analysis (i.e. explore individual variables and the relationship between variables when answering your question).

Are there a variety of relevant visualizations and statistical summaries?

The project's visualizations are varied and show multiple comparisons and trends.
At least two kinds of plots should be created as part of the explorations.
Relevant statistics are computed throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data.
Conclusions Phase
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Has the student correctly communicated tentativeness of findings?

A conclusion section is included and it refers to at least 1 limitation of your analysis, explained clearly.

The Conclusions have reflected on the steps taken during the data exploration.
The Conclusions have summarized the main findings in relation to the question(s) provided at the beginning of the analysis accurately.
The project has pointed out where additional research can be done or where additional information could be useful.
The analysis does not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.
Communication
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Is the flow of the analysis easy to follow?

The notebook has the following sections: Introduction; Questions; Data Wrangling; Exploratory Data Analysis; Conclusions, Limitation. Where you have added your commentary explainingeach of those sections. That is:

Reasoning is provided for each analysis decision, plot, and statistical summary.
Interpretation of plots and application of statistical tests should be correct and without error.
Comments are used within the code cells.
Documented the flow of analysis in the mark-down cells.
Is the data visualized using appropriate plots and parameter choices?

Visualizations made in the project depict the data in an appropriate manner (i.e., has appropriate labels, scale, legends, and plot type) that allows plots to be readily interpreted.
